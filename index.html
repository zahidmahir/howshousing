				Rules and Other Prizes:
				<br />1. You can only fill out the survey once during the month that it is activated. Multiple   submissions will disqualify you from a chance to win the prize.
				<br />2. If you filled out the survey and live in the building that has the most constructive responses,   you will automatically receive one extra programming point.
				<br />3. The How's Housing survey is given in October, December, and March. If you fill out all three surveys you will be entered into a chance to win a $150 gift card at the end of the year, along with the chance to win whatever the price will be for March.
				(For example, if March's grand prize is a $100 gift card, you will be entered into a chance to win that $100 gift card plus an additional $150 gift card if you filled out all three surveys constructively. Total value $250.)
				<br />4. Just by filling out the survey constructively when it is available, you will be entered into a chance to win the prize of that month.
